**NATIX Network** is a decentralized platform that uses your smartphone camera to help build a live map of the world.
🌍
It turns everyday cameras into smart sensors, powered by AI.
🤖
This network is designed to collect real-time data about what's happening around us-like traffic, parking spots, or crowds.
🚗🚶‍♂️🅿️
NATIX Network ensures **privacy is protected**.
🛡️
Instead of sending video footage 🎥, it only gathers and shares anonymized metadata.
🔐
This way, no personal data is stored or shared.
🚫👤

By using the NATIX Drive& app, drivers collect metadata about traffic, infrastructure, and more as they drive.
🚗📊
For sending this data, they earn points.
🎯
The app also includes gamification elements, encouraging drivers to complete specific missions.
🏆
At the end of each month, the top 3000 drivers receive $NATIX tokens as a reward.
💰
These tokens can then be transferred to the Solana network for trading.

## My Journey with NATIX

I started using NATIX in late March 2024.
After installing the app, I took my first ride as a passenger, holding the phone in my hands.
📱
It was uncomfortable and clearly a temporary fix.
Since I'm cautious with new projects, I didn't want to buy a phone holder right away.

---

Instead, I improvised with a selfie stick and some tape.
🛠️
It was a makeshift solution, but better than holding the phone during the drive.

    >
  </div>

In the first month, I didn't activate Nitro, so my results were poor.
🚫📉
Over the next few months, I improved my strategy and moved up the rankings.
📈
Eventually, I decided it was time to invest in a proper phone holder.
I researched thoroughly, looking for a model that wouldn't block my view and was easy to use.
🧐
I settled on the "iOttie Easy One Touch 5 Dash".
This setup has been perfect for me.

When using the **NATIX Drive&** app, I keep a few things in mind.
First, earning $NATIX tokens 💰 isn't why I drive.
I drive to get where I need to go, and earning tokens is a nice bonus.
🚗✨
Second, there might be bugs in app or server issues.
🐞🔧
It's important not to get frustrated.
If the server has problems, it affects everyone the same way.
📉
Most importantly, safety comes first.
🛡️
I start the app before I begin my drive and turn it off when I arrive.
📱🚦
The app doesn't block my view.
I start my drive more calmly.
😌
I stay within speed limits for better event detection.
🛣️
I use cruise control to maintain a steady speed.
🚀
Thanks to these habits, I noticed an extra benefit:
I use less fuel!
⛽️

What I regret most is joining the NATIX project so late.
😔
I know it's a valuable project with a low barrier to entry.
🚀📱
All you need to do is install the NATIX Drive& app on your phone - there's no need to buy any extra devices.
🔧

## When airdrop?

This question comes up so often on the official Discord it's annoying.
